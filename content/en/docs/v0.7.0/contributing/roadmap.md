OpenFunction encourages the community to help with prioritization. [A GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/OpenFunction/projects/3/views/1?layout=board) of OpenFunction's roadmap is available for the community to provide feedbacks on proposed issues and track them across development.

Please vote by adding a üëç on the GitHub issues for the feature capabilities you would most like to see OpenFunction support. This will help the OpenFunction maintainers to have a better understanding of your requirements.

Contributions from the community is always welcomed. If there are features on the roadmap that you are interested in contributing to, please comment on the GitHub issue and include your solution proposal.
