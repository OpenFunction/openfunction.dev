Welcome to the OpenFunction documentation site!

{{% alert title="What is OpenFunction?" color="success" %}}

[OpenFunction](https://github.com/OpenFunction/OpenFunction.git) is a cloud-native open source FaaS (Function as a Service) platform aiming to enable users to focus on their business logic without worrying about the underlying runtime environment and infrastructure. Users only need to submit business-related source code in the form of functions.
