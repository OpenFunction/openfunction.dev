Async functions are event-driven and their inputs are usually events from Non-HTTP event sources like message queues, cron triggers, MQTT brokers etc. and usually the client will not wait for an immediate response after triggering an async function by delivering an event. Below you can find some async function examples in different languages:

|           | Async Functions |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Go        | [Kafka input & HTTP output binding](https://github.com/OpenFunction/samples/tree/main/functions/async/logs-handler-function), [Cron input & Kafka output binding](https://github.com/OpenFunction/samples/tree/main/functions/async/bindings/cron-input-kafka-output), [Cron input binding](https://github.com/OpenFunction/samples/tree/main/functions/async/bindings/cron-input), [Kafka input binding](https://github.com/OpenFunction/samples/tree/main/functions/async/bindings/kafka-input), [Kafka pubsub](https://github.com/OpenFunction/samples/tree/main/functions/async/pubsub) |
| Nodejs    | [MQTT binding & pubsub](https://github.com/OpenFunction/samples/tree/main/functions/async/mqtt-io-node) |
