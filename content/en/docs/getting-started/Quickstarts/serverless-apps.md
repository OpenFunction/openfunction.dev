In addition to building and running Serverless Functions, you can also build and run Serverless Applications with OpenFuntion. 

Here you can find several Serverless Application examples:

|           | Serverless Applications |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Go | [Go App with a Dockerfile](https://github.com/OpenFunction/samples/tree/main/apps/buildah/go) |
| Java | [Java App with a Dockerfile](https://github.com/OpenFunction/samples/tree/main/apps/buildah/java),  [Java App without a Dockerfile](https://github.com/OpenFunction/samples/blob/main/apps/buildpacks/java/sample-java-app-buildpacks.yaml) & [Source Code](https://github.com/buildpacks/samples/tree/main/apps/java-maven)|
