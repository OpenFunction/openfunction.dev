This document describes how to install OpenFunction.

## Prerequisites

| OpenFunction Version | Kubernetes 1.17 | Kubernetes 1.18 | Kubernetes 1.19 | Kubernetes 1.20+ |
| -------------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| HEAD                 | √*              | √*              | √               | √                |

OpenFunction has added the [function ingress](docs/concepts/Components.md#domain) in *release-0.5*, which means that:

- You have to install OpenFunction in Kuberenetes ***v1.19*** or later if you enable this feature.
- You can still use OpenFunction in Kubernetes ***v1.17—v1.20+*** without this feature enabled.

For more information about OpenFunction components compatibility with Kubernetes, refer to [Component Compatibility Matrix](../../best-practices/customize-components#component-compatibility-matrix).
